        <h2>What did the british want from this treaty?</h2>
        <p>
          the british mostly just wanted to expand its territory while
          controlling the Aboriginal peoples. in return the indeginous peoples
          got a school in each reserve and $15 CAD for every family member but
          They werent allowed any alchohol and the reserves didnt have very good
          treatment towards the indeginous.
        </p>

        <h3>Treaty 2 today</h3>
        <p>
          after 147 years Canada and Treaty 2 are renewing their relationship by
          signing a Protocol Agreement for Advancing Reconciliation. the
          protocol will help canada and treaty 2 work together and advance on
          reconciliation.
