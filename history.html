        <h2>What did the british want from this treaty?</h2>
        <p>
          The government wanted to gain land for the crown from the First
          Nations who already lived in the desired area and to locate them to
          reserves. The desired area was tract of land stretching roughly from
          the mouth of the Winnipeg River up north to the mouth of the Berens
          River.
        </p>

        <h3>Treaty 2 today</h3>
        <p>
          after 147 years Canada and Treaty 2 are renewing their relationship by
          signing a Protocol Agreement for Advancing Reconciliation. the
          protocol will help canada and treaty 2 work together and advance on
          reconciliation.
        </p>

        <h4>What did the indeginous peoples want from this treaty</h4>
        <p>
          The Natives of this treaty mostly wanted peace between the other
          tribes, peace between each other and an abundance of land to sustain
          their people. The Natives along with Her Majesty agreed that there
          would be no consumption or distribution of alcohol on the reserves,
          and it was strictly prohibited. the Natives would be able to have a
          school on each reserve whenever they wanted and they also would have
          enough land for each family to sustain a household of five.
