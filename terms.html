        <h2>The Terms of Treaty 2</h2>

        <!-- Sourced from https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaties-1-and-2 -->
        <p>
          the Anishinaab agreed to “cede, release, surrender and yield up to Her
          Majesty the Queen, and Her successors forever” a large tract of very
          valuable land to the west and north of Manitoba as it existed in 1871,
          and three times as large as the province. It was all the land that was
          likely to be required by settlers for some time to come. In return,
          each band would receive a reserve large enough to
          <span style="color: rgb(155, 155, 155)">
            provide 160 acres for each family of five.</span

        <h3>Why Was Treaty 2 Signed?</h3>

        <!--SOURCED FROM http://fnt2t.com/index.php/2021/08/10/history-of-manitoba-house-treaty-2-on-august-21-1871/#:~:text=Treaty%20Two%20was%20created%20on,created%20to%20receive%20their%20consent.-->
        <p>
          The Treaty was signed to discuss matters of interest between the First
          Nations peoples and Her Majesty, Queen Victoria. Her Majesty wished to
          have British immigrants settle the land that the First Nations peoples
          inhabited, and the treaty was created to receive their consent. The
          treaty was established to maintain peace and goodwill between the
          First Nations peoples and the British Crown.
